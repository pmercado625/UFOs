# UFOs
## Overview  
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive website that helps users filter through a dataset to obtain information about various UFO sightings around the world.
## Results  
![cityFilter](https://github.com/pmercado625/UFOs/blob/main/static/Images/cityFiltered.png?raw=true)  
![shapeFiltered](https://github.com/pmercado625/UFOs/blob/main/static/Images/shapeFiltered.png?raw=true)  
Pictured above is the usage of the website by applying certain filters through the provided interface. As seen, the filters correctly apply and sort/filter the data to return the information as requested.
## Summary  
One potential drawback of this website would be it's limited scope of data. In order to improve the project, would could somehow link a live database that is being continuously updated in order to maintain accurate information. Additionally, the scope of the data could be expanded to include more places around the world, especially various countries.
